  Abstract                 = {The aim of this study was to develop and validate a new self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) for basic technical drawing skills based on the Technical Drawing Evaluation Grid (TDEG) (Metraglia, Baronio & Villa, 2011). One hundred and seventeen first-year engineering students completed the TDEG-SAQ (first version) at the end of a training course of technical drawing. Eight factors relating to different skills were identified. Reliability analysis ranged from 0.74 to 0.92 for the questionnaire factors and was 0.96 for the overall questionnaire. Concurrent validity analysis showed the ability of the questionnaire to distinguish between genders and high school diplomas.},
